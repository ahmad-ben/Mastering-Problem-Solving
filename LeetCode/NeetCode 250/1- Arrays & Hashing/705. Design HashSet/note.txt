Time And Space Complexity:
  My Solution 3 and Neetcode Solution:
    MyHashSet constructor:
      Time Complexity value is O(1)
      Space Complexity value is O(1)
        The space is 10000, so basically O(1).
    add:
      Time Complexity value is O(1) or O(n)
        If we hav a short or very long chain in worst case.
      Space Complexity value is O(1) 
    remove:
      Time Complexity value is O(1) or O(n)
        If we have few nodes to traverse or we have a hash collisions -worst-case scenario-.
      Space Complexity value is O(1) 
    contains:
      Time Complexity value is O(1) or O(n)
      Space Complexity value is O(1) 
        `n` represents the linked list nodes number.
