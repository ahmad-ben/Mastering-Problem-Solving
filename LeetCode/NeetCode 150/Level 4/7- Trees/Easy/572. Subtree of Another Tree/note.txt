The used Data Structure:
  Trees.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Neetcode Pattern Match Solution:
      Time Complexity value is O(n + m).
      Space Complexity value is O(n + m).
    Other Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n * m).
      Space Complexity value is O(n + m).
  Takeaway:
    If you want to preserve a value during the recursive call, you can: 
      Pass it during the recursive functions you run.
    If the logic that you trying to apply is very complex think about:
      Creating one or more helper function.
      Use more than one recursive function to simplify the process and separate your concerns.
