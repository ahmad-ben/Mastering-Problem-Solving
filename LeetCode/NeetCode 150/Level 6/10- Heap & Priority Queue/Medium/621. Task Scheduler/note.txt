The used Data Structure:
  Priority Queue / Max Heap.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n).
      `n` is the Task number.
    Space Complexity value is O(1).
      we have at most 26 different characters.
  Takeaway:
    When you are in a case when: 
      You have a set of values and you want to update them each time.
        You can think of:
          Have a global value to simulate the process, instead of looping over all of them.
