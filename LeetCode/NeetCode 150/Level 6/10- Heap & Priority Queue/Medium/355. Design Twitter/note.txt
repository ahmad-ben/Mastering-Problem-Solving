The used Data Structure:
  Priority Queue / Max Heap + Set + Map...
  Time And Space Complexity:
    My Solution:
      Twitter function:
        Time Complexity value is O(1).
        Space Complexity value is O(500) ≈ O(1).
      postTweet function:
        Time Complexity value is O(f log f).
        Space Complexity value is O(f).
          `f` is the number of follower the user has. 
      getNewsFeed function:
        Time Complexity value is O(10 log f) ≈ O(log f).
        Space Complexity value is O(1).
      follow function:
        Time Complexity value is O(p log p).
        Space Complexity value is O(p).
          `p` is the number of tweets from followees.
      unfollow function:
        Time Complexity value is O(n).
        Space Complexity value is O(n).
          `n` is the Max Priority Queue size.
    Neetcode Solution:
      Twitter constructor function:
        Time Complexity value is O(1).
        Space Complexity value is O(1).
      postTweet function:
        Time Complexity value is O(1).
        Space Complexity value is O(1).
      getNewsFeed function:
        Time Complexity value is O(n).
        Space Complexity value is O(n * m + n * m + n).
      follow function:
        Time Complexity value is O(1).
        Space Complexity value is O(1).
      unfollow function:
        Time Complexity value is O(1).
        Space Complexity value is O(1).
          `n` is the total number of followees of a user.
          `m` maximum user tweets -Max is 10-.
          `N` Total number of users.
  Takeaway:
    If you have: 
      A type of Priority Queue, for example a Max one.
      And you want to remove the smallest value, think of the Min Priority Queue.
        It can do this for you.
          Always if you can't achieve a specific behavior with MaxPQ think of the Opposite.
            Or maybe another Data Structure to help, and vice versa.
