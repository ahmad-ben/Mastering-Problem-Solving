The used Technique:
  Bit Manipulation.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    My Solution 1:
      Time Complexity value is O(log n).
        toString(2) takes almost log n time.
      Space Complexity value is O(log n).
        toString(2) creates a binary string of length log n.
    My Solution 2 And Neetcode Solution:
      Time Complexity value is O(log n).
      Space Complexity value is O(1).
    My Solution 3:
      Time Complexity value is O(k).
        `k` is the number of the set bits (bit with value 1).
        `k` can be up to log n in the worst case.
          When all bits are set.
      Space Complexity value is O(1).
        `n` is the number value.
