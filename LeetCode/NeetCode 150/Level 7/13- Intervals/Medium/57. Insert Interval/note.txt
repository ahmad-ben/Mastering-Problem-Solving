What are intervals:
  An interval comprises the numbers lying between two specific given numbers. 
  For example: 
    The set of numbers x satisfying 0 ≤ x ≤ 5 is an interval that contains:
      0, 5, and all numbers between 0 and 5.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n).
    Space Complexity value is O(1).
