The used Algorithm:
  Greedy Algorithm.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n).
    Space Complexity value is O(m).
      `n` represents the length of the string. 
      `m` represents the number of unique characters in the string.
        At most 26, so we can say it's O(1).
