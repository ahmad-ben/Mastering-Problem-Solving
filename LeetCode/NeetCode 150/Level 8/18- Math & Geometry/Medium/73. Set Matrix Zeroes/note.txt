Time And Space Complexity:
  My Solution 1:
    Time Complexity value is O(m * n).
    Space Complexity value is O(m + n).
  My Solution 2 And Neetcode Solution:
    Time Complexity value is O(m * n).
    Space Complexity value is O(1).
      `m` represents the array length. 
      `n` represents the array items length.
