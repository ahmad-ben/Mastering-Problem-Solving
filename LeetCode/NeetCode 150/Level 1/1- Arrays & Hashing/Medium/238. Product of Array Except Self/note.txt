The Used Pattern:
  Prefix and Suffix Product/Two-Pass Product Calculation.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n)
      -n- Represent the array length.
    Space Complexity value is O(1) 
      It's actually O(n) since we create an output with same size of the input.
        But the exercise description continues the following phrase:
          The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.
