The Used Algorithmic Approach:
  Backtracking.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n * 2‚Åø)
    Space Complexity value is O(n)
  Takeaway:
    If you apply the backtracking technique with two functions think of the following:
      What is my base case.
      What i should pass to each function of the two function.
        What the changes i should apply between the two functions to achieve the purpose.
