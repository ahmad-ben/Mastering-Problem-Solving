The Used Pattern:
  Stack Data Structure.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(1)
    Space Complexity value is O(n)
  Takeaway:
    Always focus in the output that the exercise asking for.
    Asking ChatGpt if your code is optimal and achieve the requirement it's a good idea.
    Try to draw the algorithm process you are working with, along with its process in each step.
      That may help you discover new improvement or potential error.
