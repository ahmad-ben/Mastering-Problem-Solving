The Used Algorithmic Approach:
  Backtracking.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Neetcode abnd My Sorted Array Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n * 2‚Åø)
      Space Complexity value is O(n)
        `n` for the recursive function.
        We didn't count the output space.
    My Other Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n * k log k)
      Space Complexity value is O(n)
        `n` for the recursive function.
        We didn't count the output space.
