The Used Pattern:
  Sliding Window.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    All Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n)
      Space Complexity value is O(1)
  Takeaway:
    Always check the kind of input you have in the problem, and that's for:
      Consider the edge cases checking. 
      Think if you can use the input limitation information to achieve the optimal solution.
        For example:
          In this case since our input consists of English lowercase letters: 
            We can think about using an array to store the input data in a specific case.
              Surely if our solution need to.
