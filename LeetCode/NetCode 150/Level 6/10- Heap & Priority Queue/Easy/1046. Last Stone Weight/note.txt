The used Data Structure:
  Priority Queue / Max Heap.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n log n).
    Space Complexity value is O(n).
  Takeaway:
    If you want to make a Min Priority Queue act as a Max Priority Queue think of:
      Add the element with the negative equivalents of their priorities values. 
      Example:
        If you have: 
          {element: "a", priority: 3}
        Add:
          {element: "a", priority: -3}
