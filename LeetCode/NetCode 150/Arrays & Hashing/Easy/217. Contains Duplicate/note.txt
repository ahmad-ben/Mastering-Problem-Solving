The Used Pattern:
  Hashing / Frequency Counting:
    Uses a hash map -or an object in JavaScript- to store and quickly look up elements.
  Commonly used in problems involving finding duplicates, intersections, or frequencies in arrays.
Time And Space Complexity:
  Time Complexity values is O(n).
    where -n- is the length of the array. This is because we traverse the array once.
  Space Complexity values is O(n).
    as the hash map can store up to -n- unique numbers in the worst case.
