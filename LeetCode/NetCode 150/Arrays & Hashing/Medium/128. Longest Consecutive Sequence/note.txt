The Used Pattern:
  Hashing/Frequency Counting.
  Takeaway:
    Each time you solve a problem try to ask yourself about:
      Each step you did or any data you saved saying:
        Is this step/data necessary?
          If yes, can i achieve the same purpose using a better and more efficient way?
          If no, delete it!
  Time And Space Complexity:
    ./Solutions/my-linear-solution.js
    ./Solutions/neetcode-solution.js
      Time Complexity value is O(n)
      Space Complexity value is O(n) 
    ./Solutions/my-sort-solution.js
      Time Complexity value is O(n log n)
      Space Complexity value is O(1)
