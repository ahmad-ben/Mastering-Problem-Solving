The Used Pattern:
  Hashing/Frequency Counting.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n²)
    Space Complexity value is O(n²) 
      The board size n × n, where -n- is the board's dimension.
      The approach scales quadratically with  n. 
        Which is optimal for problems involving  n * n grids.
