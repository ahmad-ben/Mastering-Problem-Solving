The Used Pattern:
  Hashing/Frequency Counting.
    Time And Space Complexity:
      ./Solutions/my-naive-solution.js
        Time Complexity value is O(nÂ² * m).
          -n- Represents the number of the input items.
          -m- Represents the length of the items.
        Space Complexity value is O(n * m).
          -n- Represents the size of the array.
          -m- Represents the number of unique characters in each item.
      ./Solutions/my-enhanced-solution.js
        Time Complexity value is O(n * m * log m).
          -n- Represents the number of the input items.
          -m * log m- Sort each item in the array.
        Space Complexity value is O(n * m).
          -n- Represents the size of the array.
          -m- Represents the number of unique sorted anagrams in the object.
      ./Solutions/neetcode-solution.js
        Time Complexity value is O(n * m).
          -n- Represents the number of the input items.
          -m- The iteration over each item to represent it as a ordered characters values.
        Space Complexity value is O(n * m).
          -n- Represents the size of the array.
          -m- Represents the number of unique ordered characters values in the object.
