The Used Pattern:
  Stack Data Structure.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n)
    Space Complexity value is O(n)
  Takeaway:
    If you have a kind of data you want to go through:
      Try to think about starting from different places, for example:
        If you have an array think about starting from the end.
    For each kind of data you store or process you do:
      Try to get the maximum info and benefit from it.  
      Make sure you really need it -100% necessary for the solution-.
      Make sure you can't use a more optimal way to get the same purpose that it serves.
