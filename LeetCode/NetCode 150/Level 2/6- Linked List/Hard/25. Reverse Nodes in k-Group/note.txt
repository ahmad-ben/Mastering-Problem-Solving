The used Data Structure:
  Singly Linked List.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n).
      `n` is the number of nodes.
    Space Complexity value is O(1).
  Takeaway:
    If you have a lot of linked list edge cases: 
      Think about using dummy nodes, they may make your life much easier.
