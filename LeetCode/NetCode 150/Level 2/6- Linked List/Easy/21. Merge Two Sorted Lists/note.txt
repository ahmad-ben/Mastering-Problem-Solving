This Used Data Structure:
  Singly Linked List.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Iterative solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n + m)
        n  is the number of nodes in the first linked list.
        m  is the number of nodes in the second linked list.
      Space Complexity value is O(1) 
        The solution only uses a few pointers and a dummy node for the merged list.
        It does not create new nodes for the merged list.
          It rearranges the next pointers of the existing nodes in list1 and list2.
    Recursive solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n + m)
      Space Complexity value is O(n + m)
        Each recursive call is added to the call stack.
        In the worst case, the recursion depth equals the total number of nodes in the two lists.
