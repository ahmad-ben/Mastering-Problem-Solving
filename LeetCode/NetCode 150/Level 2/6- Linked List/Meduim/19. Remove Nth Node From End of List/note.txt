  Takeaway:
    If you want to solve a problem and you don't know any information, try to:
      Ask yourself can you assume that you know the answer and move-on in your solution.
        Until you really discover the correct answer.
    If you have an unknown info that you want to rely on in order to find another info:
      Try to act like you already know that info from the given data.
      Try to build the other info from that points.
      As your assumed info changed to be more accurate remember to: 
        Correct the other info those rely on it. 
      Discover the correct info as you go, and see if this is suitable for your situation.
