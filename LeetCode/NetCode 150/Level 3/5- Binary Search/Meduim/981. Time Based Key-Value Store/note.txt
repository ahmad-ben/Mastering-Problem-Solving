The Used Pattern:
  Sliding Window.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Get method:
      Time Complexity value is O(1)
      Space Complexity value is O(K)
        K is the total calls to set, across all keys. 
          Because each call creates and stores a single {timestamp, value} object.
    Set method:
      Time Complexity value is O(log n)
      Space Complexity value is O(1)
