The used Data Structure:
  Trees.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n).
    Space Complexity value is O(n).
  Takeaway:
    When working with trees, if you feel the need for a stack.
      To temporarily hold values until a specific condition or point is met. 
        Consider using Depth-First Search -DFS-.
          DFS naturally uses the call stack during recursion. 
            Effectively storing values along the way.
          This approach can reduce the need for an explicit stack. 
            Leveraging recursion to manage the traversal and decision-making process.
