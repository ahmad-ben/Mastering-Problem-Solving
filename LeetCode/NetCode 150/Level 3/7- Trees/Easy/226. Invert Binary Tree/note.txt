The used Data Structure:
  Trees.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Neetcode Recursive Solution:
      Time Complexity value is O(n).
      Space Complexity value is O(n).
        `n` is the number of nodes.
    Other Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n).
      Space Complexity value is O(log n) Or O(n).
        `n` is the number of nodes.
        If we have: 
          Skewed tree, so we are talking about the worst case, it will be:
            O(n).
          Balanced tree, so we are talking about the average case, it will be:
            O(log n).
  Takeaway:
    If you have a lot of linked list edge cases: 
      Think about using dummy nodes, they may make your life much easier.
