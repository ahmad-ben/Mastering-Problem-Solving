The used Data Structure:
  Trees.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Dfs Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n).
      Space Complexity value is O(h).
        `h` is the tree height.
          In a balanced tree is O(log n).
          In a skewed tree it can be O(n).
    Bfs Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n).
      Space Complexity value is O(n).
  Takeaway:  
    BFS approach, problems and solutions:
      How to separate between the nodes of different levels in our queue:
        Store the size of the Queue in the beginning of each loop process.
          Before applying this approach or any other approach: 
            Ask yourself if you really need it.
      How to preserve a value from the previous level:
        Store the wanted value along with each node in your queue.
          In this case you may not need to separate the levels anymore.
    DFS:
      In case: 
        You want to pass a value to a node. 
        This value it belongs to the path between this node and the root.
          You can simply pass it through the recursive call.
