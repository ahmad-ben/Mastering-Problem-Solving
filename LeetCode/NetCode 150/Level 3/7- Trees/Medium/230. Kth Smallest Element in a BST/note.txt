The used Data Structure:
  Trees.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    DFS Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n).
      Space Complexity value is O(h).
        `h` is the tree height.
    Stack Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(n).
      Space Complexity value is O(h).
        `h` is the tree height.
