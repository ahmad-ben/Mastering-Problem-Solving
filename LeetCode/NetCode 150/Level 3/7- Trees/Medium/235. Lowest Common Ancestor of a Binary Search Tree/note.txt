The used Data Structure:
  Trees.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Optimal Solutions:
      Time Complexity value is O(h).
        `h` is the tree height.
        In a balanced tree is basically O(log n).
      Space Complexity value is O(1).
    Neetcode dfs Solution:
      Time Complexity value is O(h).
      Space Complexity value is O(h).
    My dfs Solution:
      Time Complexity value is O(n).
      Space Complexity value is O(h).
  Takeaway:  
    In case of using a recursion function, we should always thing of:
      What the function should do.
        What kind of work that's repetitive in each time.
      What the function should return. 
      What the base case we should stop on. 
    If you have a binary search tree, always try to use its properties.
      Aiming to get the most optimal solution.
