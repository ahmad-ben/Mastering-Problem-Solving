The Used Pattern:
  Sliding Window.
  Time And Space Complexity:
    Time Complexity value is O(n)
      `n` is the length of the string.
    Space Complexity value is O(m)
      `m` is the total number of unique characters in the strings.
  Takeaway:
    If you have a process that take from you an O(n) and you want to make it more efficient:
      Think about what you are asking for by this process -Your purpose, the wanted data-.
      Can you achieve this wanted data without this process.
        For example by keep track of this data in the changing time.
          Real example:
            To get the index of an item in an array that's O(n).
            But if you save the index of the item along with it in an object in the insertion time. 
              That will be O(1).
