Steps to Maximize the Benefits of the Problem-Solving Process:
  Understand the Algorithm:
    Carefully study the algorithm used in each problem and try to explain it in your own words.
  Identify the Problem Pattern:
    Don't focus on the individual question.
    Recognize the underlying pattern in the problem. 
    This will help you apply similar techniques to other problems.
  Explore Other Solutions:
    Look at different approaches, like: 
      Solutions from the comments section. 
      YouTube tutorials.
      ChatGPT. 
    This will give you insight into alternative methods and optimization opportunities.
  Analyze Time and Space Complexity:
    Always evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution to understand its efficiency.
    This is crucial for:
      Scaling solutions to handle larger inputs.
      Training yourself to identify the correct complexity of your solutions.
  Respect the Problem Order:
    Start with the easier problems and gradually work your way up to the harder ones.
    This helps:
      Make the process enjoyable. 
      Building a strong foundation in DSA and design patterns to tackle more complex challenges.
  Practice Regularly:
    Continuously solving problems is key to improving. 
    Aim for variety to cover different types of algorithms and data structures.
  Reflect on the Process:
    After solving the problem, review your thought process and identify areas for improvement. 
    Could you have optimized your solution or solved it in a different way?
  Be Honest and Avoid Time-Wasting -I am still straggling with this attitude ðŸ¤­-:
    If you're unable to solve a problem after a specific amount of time.
      Generally after 1 to 2 hours of focused effort.
        Don't hesitate to review the solution.
    Acknowledge when you're stuck, it's part of the learning process. 
      Studying the solution will help you understand new approaches and unblock your thinking.
  Ask important questions:
    After finish each problem try to ask yourself some critical questions like:  
      What's the one thing knowing it make the problem easier.
      If you have inefficient solution, ask yourself:
        Why i didn't think about the optimal solution?
          My approach problem.
        How can i discovered the most efficient solution in the next time.
          Action taking to avoid the same mistake.
        Do i have any kind of data/logic i can rely on to make my solution even better.
          Think about what does each piece of data/logic mean and provide.
General Info:
  In interviews, the focus is generally on solving medium-level problems within 45 min to 1 hour.
    It's rare to encounter hard problems in interviews.
      If you do, you'll usually be provided with hints to guide you.
